# The-Budgety-Project

This particular project was an exercise in writing my first actual app during the "Complete JavaScript Course" by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. It's a simple and clean budget-calculator which receives both income and expenses from the user to calculate their monthly budget.

Given that the app is a code-along exercise and, therefore, not my intellectual property, the finished version I've put up still has all of my working comments included, as I wrote them with a lot of detail so I would be able to cross-reference them later to refresh my knowledge, but also to show familiarity with all the material I've covered during my course, especially:

1) Scoping
2) Closures
3) IIFE's
4) Modules
5) DOM manipulation
6) Basic app architecture
